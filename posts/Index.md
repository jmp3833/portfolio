<!--Hello, World!-->

At the moment I just intend to use this site to display my portfolio and write about things that interest me, whether they involve software development or not. Since I'm developing the blog portion from scratch, I would love it if you took a look at the [source](https://github.com/jmp3833/portfolio "source") and suggest ways I could improve the site!

I've spent most of my time as a software Engineering student at RIT focusing on Web Development purely by coincidence. As of late, I've been getting into mobile development mainly on the iOS side as well. 

Through college and some personal projects I've dabbled with technologies ranging from ARM assembler and VHDL up to full web development stacks. My interests have been all across the map these past two years.
